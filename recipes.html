            <h2>Mussels in Light Broth</h2>
            <p><u>INGREDIENTS</u></p>
            <ul>
               <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
               <li>1 tablespoon peeled, finely chopped fresh ginger</li>
               <li>2 garlic cloves, finely chopped</li>
               <li>1 tablespoon cumin seeds (coarsely crushed in a mortar and pestle)</li>
               <li>10–12 whole black peppercorns, coarsely crushed in a mortar and pestle</li>
               <li>1/4 teaspoon asafoetida powder</li>
               <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
               <li>16 ounces canned crushed tomatoes or 2 cups peeled, diced fresh tomatoes</li>
               <li>1/2 cup finely chopped cilantro leaves and stems</li>
               <li>2 pounds fresh mussels</li>
               <li>1 tablespoon Tempered Oil</li>
               <li>2 tablespoons oil</li>
               <li>10–12 curry leaves</li>
               <li>1 teaspoon brown mustard seeds</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
            <blockquote cite="https://www.jamesbeard.org/recipes/mussels-in-light-broth"> A 4-quart pot over medium heat, add the oil. Add the ginger, garlic, cumin, black peppercorns, asafoetida, and salt. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Add the tomatoes and cilantro and cook for 5 minutes,
               stirring occasionally. Add 2 cups of water and cook for 8 minutes on a low heat. Add the mussels, cover and cook for 5 to 6 minutes, or until the mussels are opened. Remove from the heat. Transfer the mussels and broth
               to a serving bowl and finish with the tempered oil. To make the Tempered Oil: In a small pan over medium heat, add oil. Add the curry leaves and mustard seeds; when the mustard seeds begin to pop, remove the oil from the
               flame, about 30 seconds. Drizzle the oil over the mussels and broth. Cooks' Note Mussels attach themselves to stable surfaces using thin, sticky, weedy membranes referred to as “beards,” which must be removed before
               cooking. Most farm-raised mussels purchased in grocery stores have already been debearded. If the beard is still attached, grasp it with your fingers and pull it downward toward the hinged end of the shell. Pull firmly
               until it comes out and discard it. Place mussels in a colander in the sink, and run cold water over them to get rid of any visible dirt or grit on the outer shells. Using a vegetable brush, scrub each shell under running
               water. Overlooked grit can ruin a dish.

            <h2>Steamed Mussels with Tomato and Chorizo Broth</h2>
            <p><u>INGREDIENTS...</u></p>
            <p>
               Heat chorizo and 2 tablespoons oil in a large heavy pot over medium, stirring occasionally, until chorizo begins to brown and crisp, about 4 minutes. Add garlic and fennel seeds and cook, stirring, until fragrant, about
               1 minute. Add tomatoes and wine and bring to a simmer; season with pepper. Cook until reduced by three-quarters, 6–8 minutes. Add mussels. Cover and cook, stirring occasionally, until mussels open, 6–8 minutes. Discard
               any mussels that don't open. Drizzle toast with oil. Serve mussels topped with tarragon with toast alongside.

            <h2>Cioppino</h2>
            <p><u>INGREDIENTS...</u></p>
            <p>
               <b><em>For broth:</em></b><br />
               Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until softened, 8-10 minutes. Add garlic, basil, oregano, and red pepper flakes; stir until fragrant, about 3 minutes. Remove pot
               from heat and add wine. Return pot to heat, bring to a boil, and cook until wine is reduced by half, about 4 minutes. Add tomatoes with juices, crushing with your hands as you add them. Cook, stirring occasionally, until
               thickened, 15-20 minutes. Add clam juice, parsley, bay leaves, and 8 cups water; season with salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until flavors meld, 10-15 minutes more. Discard parsley sprigs and
               bay leaves. DO AHEAD: Broth can be made 2 days ahead. Let cool slightly; chill until cold. Cover and keep chilled. Reheat before continuing.
               <br />
               <b><em>For soup:</em></b><br />
               Heat oil in a large heavy pot over medium heat. Add shallot; stir often until softened, about 3 minutes. Add garlic; stir until fragrant, about 1 minute. Remove from heat; add mussels and wine. Set over medium-high heat,
               cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until shells open (discard any that do not open), about 4 minutes. Add reserved broth; bring to a simmer. Add fish and shrimp. Cover; cook just until opaque, about 4 minutes. Stir
               in butter; season with salt and pepper. Divide among bowls; top with parsley. Serve with toast.
